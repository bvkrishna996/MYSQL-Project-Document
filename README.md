# 🛒 Grocery Store Management – SQL Project

Welcome to my SQL-based project for Grocery Store Management! This project simulates the data system of a mini grocery store and answers key business questions using SQL queries.

---

## 📦 Project Contents

- **grocery_schema.sql** – Contains the SQL schema, i.e., database creation and table definitions.
- **grocery_queries.sql** – Contains all SQL queries to extract insights and answer business questions.
- **Data sets.zip** – Sample data used to populate the database tables.
- **grocery_erdiagram.png** – ER diagram representing the database structure.
- **README.md** – You’re reading it now 😊

## 📚 What This Project Is About

This project helps analyze and manage data related to a grocery store’s:

- Products and their suppliers
- Customers and their orders
- Employee performance
- Sales and revenue trends

The database includes **7 interrelated tables**:

1. `supplier`
2. `categories`
3. `employees`
4. `customers`
5. `products`
6. `orders`
7. `order_details`

## ⚠️ Note on Table Creation and Data Import

**Please create tables and import data one by one in a specific order instead of executing all scripts together.**

### Why?
Tools like MySQL Workbench may arrange tables alphabetically in the schema browser, which can:
- Obscure the logical flow of data (e.g., supplier → products → orders)
- Make foreign key relationships harder to understand
- Be confusing for beginners debugging or tracking dependencies

### Our Approach
We follow this logical order for clarity:
1. supplier
2. categories
3. employees
4. customers
5. products
6. orders
7. order_details

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Design a relational database schema using SQL
- Use SQL queries to extract business insights
- Analyze customer behavior, product sales, employee activity, and trends

## ❓ Business Analysis Questions Covered

This project answers real-world business questions such as:

### 1. Customer Insights
- How many unique customers have placed orders?
- Which customers have placed the highest number of orders?
- What is the total and average purchase value per customer?
- Who are the top 5 customers by total purchase amount?

### 2. Product Performance
- How many products exist in each category?
- What is the average price of products by category?
- Which products have the highest total sales volume (by quantity)?
- What is the total revenue generated by each product?
- How do product sales vary by category and supplier?

### 3. Sales and Order Trends
- How many orders have been placed in total?
- What is the average value per order?
- On which dates were the most orders placed?
- What are the monthly trends in order volume and revenue?
- How do order patterns vary across weekdays and weekends?

### 4. Supplier Contribution
- How many suppliers are there in the database?
- Which supplier provides the most products?
- What is the average price of products from each supplier?
- Which suppliers contribute the most to total product sales (by revenue)?

### 5. Employee Performance
- How many employees have processed orders?
- Which employees have handled the most orders?
- What is the total sales value processed by each employee?
- What is the average order value handled per employee?

### 6. Order Details Deep Dive
- What is the relationship between quantity ordered and total price?
- What is the average quantity ordered per product?
- How does the unit price vary across products and orders?

These insights are generated using a wide range of SQL skills including joins, subqueries, aggregations, grouping, and date-based analysis.

## 🛠️ SQL Concepts Used

- JOINs (INNER, LEFT)
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- Aggregations: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT()
- Subqueries
- CASE statements
- Date formatting: STR_TO_DATE(), MONTHNAME(), DAYNAME()

---

## 💻 Tools Used

- MySQL / MySQL Workbench for database creation and querying
- PowerPoint for visual storytelling of business insights
- GitHub for version control and project hosting

---


## 📊 Datasets

All `.csv` files used for importing data into tables are available in the `/datasets` folder or as a ZIP file (`grocery_datasets.zip`), including:

- supplier.csv
- categories.csv
- employees.csv
- customers.csv
- products.csv
- orders.csv
- order_details.csv

You can import these into your SQL tool to populate the tables after creating the schema.

---

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. Open MySQL Workbench or any SQL client.
2. Run `grocery_schema.sql` to create all tables in the correct order.
3. Import data from CSVs one by one using the table names.
4. Run `grocery_queries.sql` to perform analysis and extract insights.
5. Use the ER diagram and PowerPoint slides for presentation if needed.
